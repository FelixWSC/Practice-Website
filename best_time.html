    <p class="time"> Looking for the northern or southern light is never guaranteed and is always a risk, but there are times when the lights are more visible/likely to be seen. Though the aurora can be seen at any time of the year, the most important thing is to have clear, dark skies that will give the best visibility. This also means visiting them during winter to increase your chances. The northern lights are best viewed from August through to late February while the southern lights are best viewed between March to September.</p>
