    <h2>What are the Northern and Southern lights?</h2>
    <p class= "what_are">The Northern and the Southern lights aka Aurora Borealis (Northern lights) and Aurora Australis (Southern lights) are a beautiful celestial phenomenon where light dances across the sky in flashing wavy colours. They are auroras seen from either, the northern hemisphere and the top of the globe (Northern lights) or the southern hemisphere and the bottom of the globe (Southern lights). </p>
