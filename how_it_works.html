    <p>The Northern and Southern lights are created by charged high energy particles coming from the sun, as they interact with Earth its magnetic field channels them towards the Earth's magnetic poles (the northern and southern poles) this creates a process that results in a glowing field of excited gas. The charged particles interact with atoms in our upper atmosphere creating beautiful sheets of light often lasting for hours that create many beautiful colours dancing gracefully in our polar skies. </p>
